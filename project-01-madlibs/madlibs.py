"""
EXTRAS:
-Instead of specifying the sentences or story to convert, write a story in a file and read it from your program. Make sure to include the file in your repo and that your program reads it correctly.
-Add some replacements that are unique, that is, the first time you see them you select on randomly but then you keep reusing that replacement.
-Pay attention to letter case. That is, if you replace a word at the beginning of a sentence, it should be capitalized, otherwise, lowercase. This is except in the case of proper nouns which should always be capitalized.
